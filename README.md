# Busbud App

## Setup

In your terminal...
* Clone app: `$ git clone https://github.com/hjmccain/bus-schedule.git < YOUR DIR NAME >`
* Install dependencies: `$ npm install`

In separate terminal tabs...
* Run server: `node server`
* Run react app: `yarn run dev`

After running yarn start, the app should automatically open on local port 3000. Alternatively, you can run the built app with `yarn start` â€” look for it on port 8080. This works well if you're not planning on making any changes to the app.
