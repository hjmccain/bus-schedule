      Thanks for the opportunity to tackle this project!
      I hope you enjoy my implementation of your code challenge.
      My goal was to implement all of the basic requirements in a
      clean, attractive interface. I hope you'll find my code to
      be clear, modular but not fragmented, and programmer-friendly.
      If you have any questions about the code or the product,
      don't hesitate to get in touch.
      <br /><br />
      Best,
      <br />
